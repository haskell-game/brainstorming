-- CR jmcarthur: After thinking about it a bit, here is my opinion on this.
-- If you imagine a 2D plot where one axis is type safety and the other is
-- straightforwardness, doing nothing interesting would be close to the (0,1)
-- extreme, going all out would be close to the (1,0) extreme, and I think
-- this approach would sit around (4,4). That's okay, but I think it is more
-- important that the interface be simple than that it be type safe. We are
-- shooting for this being as approachable as possible. Most bugs this prevents
-- are going to be immediately visible at runtime anyway; there is little risk
-- of them lurking and only biting after you have long forgotten about the code.
-- Also, being merely phantom types, this could just be implemented on top
-- anyway, if somebody wants it, and then they get to do it however they want.

The goal here is to make as many potential bugs into type errors as possible
without too many trade-offs. The unfortunate fact is that we don't have enough
expressive power to make everything work all the time, so rather than true 
type-enforced correctness the emphasis is on making it easy to use types to
keep track of what things should be.

As such, it avoids:
- Needlessly duplicated implementations
- Type hackery and the pile of GHC extensions that comes with
- Lots of conversions needed for common tasks
- Restrictions the user can't circumvent if they need to

The basic approach here is to have a single representation with a phantom type
tag and an exported constructor. Functions can be specialized with the phantom
type, including a sort of hierarchy by leaving some polymorphic bits in.

The details of the phantom type information are flexible and could easily be
revised from what's used here

example: 'Rect (Screen Pixel)' is a rectangle measured in pixels on the screen, 
e.g. the viewport window. it's composed of two values with types 
'Cd2 (Point (Screen Pixel))' and 'Cd2 (Vec (Screen Pixel))' representing the 
top-left corner and the size or something.
