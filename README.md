The Haskell Game Library
========================

This initiative aims to improve the *status quo* of developing games
and other multimedia applications using Haskell. We will create a set
of modular libraries with the intent that they be good enough to
become the *de facto* standards for starting new games in Haskell.

Goals
-----

The interfaces must be simple and high level. The process of creating
a game should be straightforward. (TODO get more specific)

The libraries we create will be fully supported on at least the three
major desktop operating systems: Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Support
for other operating systems and the browser are not primary goals, but
we would be willing to try to make the job easy for a contributor,
especially if you get involved early.

Any barrier to entry should be as low as possible. While getting this
into the Haskell Platform is not a primary goal, we desire the same
criteria that would be necessary for a reasonable candidacy, such as
limiting our dependencies and avoiding conflicts with other Haskell
Platform packages.

(TODO all the other stuff we discussed in #haskell-game)
